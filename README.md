# Awesome Data hoaring

### What is data hoarding

From the data hoarding subreddit side pannel

> We are digital librarians. Among us are represented the various 
> reasons to keep data -- legal requirements, competitive requirements, 
> uncertainty of permanence of cloud services, distaste for transmitting 
> your data externally (e.g. government or corporate espionage), cultural 
> and familial archivists, internet collapse preppers, and people who do 
> it themselves so they're sure it's done right. Everyone has their 
> reasons for curating the data they have decided to keep (either forever 
> or For A Damn Long Timetm). Along the way we have sought out like-minded
>  individuals to exchange strategies, war stories, and cautionary tales 
> of failures.
